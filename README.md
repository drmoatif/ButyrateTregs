# Butyrate Paper
 
Key instructions to start analysing data
The R code for the paper is in the Butyrate_Sept22.R file and the Seurat object utilised is called Expanded_Tregs.rds.

After importing the RDS file into RStudio, please load the packages listed within the first few lines of the code. The rest of the code should be run in a sequential manner depending on your data points/plots of interest. We have added comments for different aspects such as differential expression of either RNA or ADT (surface protein) modalities, correlations between modalities, heatmaps for signalling pathways or transcription factors analysis etc.

For further questions, please email the corresponding author of the paper. We would be delighted to help.
